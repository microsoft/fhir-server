-- STORED PROCEDURE
--     Deletes a single resource's history, and optionally the resource itself

-- DESCRIPTION

--     Data remains recoverable from the transaction log, however.
--
-- PARAMETERS
--     @resourceTypeId
--         * The ID of the resource type (See ResourceType table)
--     @resourceId
--         * The resource ID (must be the same as in the resource itself)
--     @keepCurrentVersion
--         * When 1, the current resource version kept, else all data is removed.
