       A write transaction (update/delete) on the rows that match 
       the search condition of the select statement will wait until the current transaction is completed. 
       Other transactions can insert new rows that match the search conditions of statements issued by the current transaction.
       But, other transactions will be blocked to insert new rows during the execution of the select query, 
       and wait until the execution completes. */
