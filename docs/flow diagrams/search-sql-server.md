When SQL query-plan reuse is disabled and the generator emits its existing parameter hash comment, the same
comment also contains a value-free FHIR query shape:

```sql
/* HASH <parameter-hash> params=@p0,@p1 fhir=Patient?birthdate&name */
```

The shape is created by `SearchOptionsFactory` from the search scope and the parsed query parameter names
already supplied to the search pipeline. Ordinary searches use `Patient?...`, history searches use
`Patient/_history?...`, and compartment searches omit the compartment ID and use
`Patient/$compartment/Observation?...`. Names are sorted using ordinal ordering and repeated names are retained,
so changing parameter values or query-string order does not change the annotation. Parameter values and
compartment IDs are never included. Unsafe comment/control characters are replaced, and output longer than 256
characters is truncated to 255 characters plus `~`.

This SQL generation path is used by ordinary, compartment, and history searches, including the internal
search phases used by Patient `$everything`. The annotation describes the generated target-resource query
shape; it does not attempt to identify the originating HTTP operation. Include and reverse-include syntax is
preserved when those parameter names are present.
