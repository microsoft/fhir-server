# Update the PR validation workflow to require ADR labeling. 

- All pull requests must now include one of the following labels: ADR-Included or No-ADR, indicating whether documentation for the change is provided or not.

- This ensures that every change is accompanied by its rationale and details, making it easier to track the context behind modifications in the future without scrambling to figure out who made the change and why.
