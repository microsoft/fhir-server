## Azure Health Data Services (SQL)

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed search parameter synchronization issues across multiple instances
**Old behavior:** Search parameters were not being properly synchronized across multiple FHIR server instances, leading to inconsistent behavior when search parameters were added or updated.
**New behavior:** Implemented SearchParameterCacheRefreshBackgroundService for cross-pod synchronization of Search Parameter changes with configurable refresh intervals.
**Impact:** Resolves multi-instance SearchParameter synchronization issues in distributed deployments.
[PR #5150](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/5150) - [AB#170098](https://microsofthealth.visualstudio.com/Health/_workitems/edit/170098)

#### Resolved compartment search expression comparison bug
**Old behavior:** Compartment search expressions were not properly considering compartmentId during comparison, causing duplicate expressions and incorrect search results.
**New behavior:** Search expressions now properly check compartmentId when comparing, and handle multiple compartment expressions correctly.
**Impact:** Fixes search result accuracy for compartment-based queries.
[PR #5137](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/5137) - [AB#169470](https://microsofthealth.visualstudio.com/Health/_workitems/edit/169470)

#### Fixed system-level SMART search with compartment resources
**Old behavior:** System-level searches with historical records and access to all resources were not returning compartment resources properly.
**New behavior:** Compartment resources are now correctly returned when searching on system level with historical records and access to all resources.
**Impact:** Ensures complete search results for SMART-enabled applications.
[PR #5141](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/5141) - [AB#169986](https://microsofthealth.visualstudio.com/Health/_workitems/edit/169986)

#### Corrected count logic for bulk update partition jobs
**Old behavior:** Resource type-surrogate id partition bulk update jobs had incorrect count logic, leading to improper job execution.
**New behavior:** Fixed the count logic to properly handle resource type-surrogate id partition bulk update jobs.
**Impact:** Improves reliability of bulk update operations.
[PR #5134](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/5134) - [AB#168715](https://microsofthealth.visualstudio.com/Health/_workitems/edit/168715)

#### Fixed search parameter enablement after reindex completion
**Old behavior:** Search parameters with no impacted resources were not being marked as enabled after reindex job completion.
**New behavior:** All search parameters are now properly marked as enabled after reindex completion, regardless of whether they have impacted resources.
**Impact:** Ensures all custom search parameters are usable after creation.
[PR #5132](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/5132) - [AB#168980](https://microsofthealth.visualstudio.com/Health/_workitems/edit/168980)

#### Resolved custom search parameter conflicts with built-in functionality
**Old behavior:** Custom SearchParameters with the same code as built-in parameters were affecting built-in search functionality.
**New behavior:** Custom search parameters no longer interfere with built-in search functionality when they share the same code.
**Impact:** Maintains system stability while allowing custom search parameter flexibility.
[PR #5024](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/5024) - [AB#117004](https://microsofthealth.visualstudio.com/Health/_workitems/edit/117004)

#### Eliminated race conditions in search parameter operations
**Old behavior:** Concurrent search parameter create, update, or delete operations would fail unpredictably due to race conditions.
**New behavior:** Implemented robust two-layer concurrency control with application-level pessimistic locking and database-level optimistic concurrency.
**Impact:** Ensures reliable search parameter operations in high-load environments.
[PR #5097](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/5097) - [AB#164155](https://microsofthealth.visualstudio.com/Health/_workitems/edit/164155)

### Enhancements

#### Improved bulk update operation performance
**Enhancement:** Optimized bulk update operations by processing records in batches of 1,000 instead of 10,000, enqueuing CT-level sub-jobs immediately after reading each page, and verifying job status before creating new ones.
**Impact:** Significantly improves bulk update performance and resource utilization.
[PR #5124](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/5124) - [AB#168715](https://microsofthealth.visualstudio.com/Health/_workitems/edit/168715)

#### Enhanced async operation query optimization
**Enhancement:** Included ResourceSurrogateId in query hash for async operations to improve query caching and performance.
**Impact:** Better query optimization and caching for background operations.
[PR #5128](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/5128) - [AB#167462](https://microsofthealth.visualstudio.com/Health/_workitems/edit/167462)

## Common Platform

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed URL construction for bundles with forwarded headers
**Old behavior:** Bundle URL construction was incorrect when using forwarded headers, leading to malformed URLs.
**New behavior:** Properly constructs URLs by appending "/" to BaseUri and correctly extracting Path from bundle entries.
**Impact:** Resolves URL issues in proxy scenarios for bundle operations.
[PR #5129](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/5129)

### Enhancements

#### Enhanced import statistics with ImportMode information
**Enhancement:** Added ImportMode as part of Import Statistics to provide better visibility into import operations.
**Impact:** Improved monitoring and diagnostics for import operations.
[PR #5145](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/5145) - [AB#170321](https://microsofthealth.visualstudio.com/Health/_workitems/edit/170321)

#### Updated documentation with architecture details
**Enhancement:** Added architecture section and ProcessingUnitBytesToRead parameter documentation to import documentation.
**Impact:** Better understanding of system architecture and configuration options.
[PR #5133](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/5133)

#### Simplified generic parameter naming
**Enhancement:** Replaced ProcessingJobBytesToRead with more generic ProcessingUnitBytesToRead for better consistency.
**Impact:** Improved parameter naming consistency across the codebase.
[PR #5127](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/5127)

### Infrastructure Changes

#### Reverted network service perimeter associations
**Infrastructure:** Temporarily reverted CosmosDB association to network service perimeter due to deployment issues.
**Impact:** Maintains service availability while security configurations are adjusted.
[PR #5149](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/5149)

#### Updated deployment region configuration
**Infrastructure:** Changed resource group region from eastus2 to westus2 to avoid Cosmos DB Account provisioning failures.
**Impact:** Improves deployment reliability by using more stable regions.
[PR #5136](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/5136) - [AB#169462](https://microsofthealth.visualstudio.com/Health/_workitems/edit/169462)

#### Performance testing improvements
