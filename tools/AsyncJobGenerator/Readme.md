Known limitations:
- The file src\Microsoft.Health.Fhir.Shared.Api/Microsoft.Health.Fhir.Shared.Api.projitems still needs to be manually updated to include the new controller or the file won't compile or display in VS.
- The Controller will include methods for all three operation levels regardless of the switches given to the script
- Does not create the operation documents or update the operation definition controller
