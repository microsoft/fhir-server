# R4 Resource Parser
This library makes use of the Microsoft.Health.Fhir.Core library to create a resource parser that can operate independently of a web service or database. Its primary purpose is to create ResourceWrapper objects from JSON formatted strings, and vice-versa. 
The ResourceWrapperParser class is the entry point to this library. See the ResourceParser project for an example of how this library can be used.
