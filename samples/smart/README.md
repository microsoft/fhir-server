This sample demonstrates how Azure Health Data Services can be used to pass the Inferno test for ONC (g)(10) compliance, using Azure Active Directory as the identity provider. Azure Health Data Services is the core of this sample, additionally there is custom code and routing required to fully meet the ยง170.315(g)(10) Standardized API for patient and population services criteriarequirements. This sample can be used as a reference for building your application and solution to pass Inferno tests for ONC (g)(10).

Note : This sample relies Azure Active Directory as the identity provider. You would need to build a custom solution for identity provider other than Azure Active Directory.

Targeted audience : EHR vendors who are looking to pass ONC (g)(10).
