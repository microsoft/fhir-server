  > 
  >    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

  >       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
  >       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
  >       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
  >       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
  >       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  >       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
  >       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
  >       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

  >       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
  >       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
  >       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  > 
  >       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

  >       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
  >       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
  >       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
  >       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

  >       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
  >       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
  >       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
  >       as of the date such litigation is filed.
  > 
  >    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

  >           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
  >           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
  >           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
  >           the Derivative Works; and
  > 
  >       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
  >           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
  >           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
  >           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
  >           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
  >           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
  >           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
  >           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
  >           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
  >           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
  >           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
  >           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
  >           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
  >           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
  >           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
  >           as modifying the License.
  > 
  >       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
  >       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
  >       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
  >       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
  >       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
  >       the conditions stated in this License.
  > 
  >    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
  >       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
  >       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
  >       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
  >       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
  >       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
  >       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  > 
  >    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
  >       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
  >       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
  >       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  > 
  >    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
  >       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
  >       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
  >       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
  >       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

  >       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
  >       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
  >       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  > 
  >    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  >       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  >       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  >       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  >       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
  >       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
  >       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
  >       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  >       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  >       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
  >       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  >
