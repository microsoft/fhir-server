  >           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
  >           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
  >           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
  >           as modifying the License.
  > 
  >       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
  >       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

  >       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
  >       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  > 
  >    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

  >       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  > 
  >    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
  >       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

  >       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
  >       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  > 
  >    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  >       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  >       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  >       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  >       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
  >       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
  >       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
  >       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  >       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  >       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
  >       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  > 
  >    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
  >       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
  >       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
  >       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
  >       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
  >       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
  >       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
  >       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
  >       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
  >       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
